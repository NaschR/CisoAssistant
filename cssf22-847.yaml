      description: "Luxembourg, 5 January 2024\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe purpose\
        \ of this Circular is to introduce a new ICT-related incident reporting framework\
        \ in order\nto acquire a better and more structured overview of the nature,\
        \ frequency, significance and impact\nof ICT-related incidents, also considering\
        \ the growing ICT and security risk in the context of a highly\ninterconnected\
        \ global financial system.\nThe provisions of this Circular are based on Article\
        \ 53(1) of the Law of 5 April 1993 on the financial\nsector, as amended (hereafter\
        \ \u201CLFS\u201D), Article 31(4) of the Law of 10 November 2009 on payment\n\
        services, as amended (hereafter \u201CLPS\u201D), Article 2 of the Law of\
        \ 15 December 2000 on postal financial\nservices, as amended, Article 147\
        \ of the Law of 17 December 2010 relating to undertakings for\ncollective\
        \ investment, as amended (hereafter \u201CUCITS Law\u201D), Article 50 of\
        \ the Law of 12 July 2013\non alternative investment fund managers, as amended\
        \ (hereafter \u201CAIFM Law\u201D), Article 2(1) of the\nLaw of 15 March 2016\
        \ on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, as amended\n\
        (hereafter \u201CEMIR Law\u201D), Article 2(1) of the Law of 17 April 2018\
        \ on benchmarks (hereafter\n\u201CBenchmark Law\u201D), Article 2 of the Law\
        \ of 6 June 2018 on Central Securities Depositories (hereafter\n\u201CCSD\
        \ Law\u201D), and Article 20-16 of the Law of 16 July 2019 on the operationalisation\
        \ of European\nregulations in the area of financial services.\nAccording to\
        \ Article 3 of the Law of 28 May 2019 on Network and Information Systems (hereafter\n\
        \u201CNIS Law\u201D), the CSSF is also the competent authority in terms of\
        \ network and information security\nfor the credit institutions and the financial\
        \ market infrastructures that have been identified as\nOperators of Essential\
        \ Services (hereafter \u201COES\u201D), as well as for Digital Service Providers\
        \ (hereafter\n\u201CDSP\u201D) which are already under the supervision of\
        \ the CSSF (\u201CNIS authority\u201D). The objective of this\ncircular is\
        \ to lay down the practical details and modalities for the reporting obligations\
        \ set forth in\nArticles 8(4), 8(5), 9(1), 11(3) and 11(4) and 12 of the NIS\
        \ Law and in CSSF Regulation No 24-01\nCIRCULAR CSSF 24/847 3/24\nrelating\
        \ to the notification of incidents according to the Law of 28 May 20191 (hereafter\
        \ \u201CCSSF\nRegulation No 24-01\u201D) regarding specifically Articles 8(5)\
        \ and 11(3) of the NIS Law.\nThis Circular brings the following changes to\
        \ the current incident reporting mechanism:\n\u2022 Increases the incident\
        \ coverage, currently limited to fraud and incidents due to external\ncomputer\
        \ attacks as per Circular CSSF 11/504, by covering more broadly ICT operational\
        \ and\nsecurity incidents while avoiding double reporting for incidents to\
        \ be notified under other incident\nnotification frameworks.\n\u2022 Introduces\
        \ reporting based on classification. Supervised Entities will be required\
        \ to classify ICTrelated incidents based on the criteria indicated in this\
        \ Circular and to notify to the CSSF the\ncases where ICT-related incidents\
        \ are classified as major or significant incidents.\n\u2022 Introduces a new\
        \ incident reporting notification form. To obtain data in a structured form,\n\
        Supervised Entities will be required to complete and submit an ICT-related\
        \ incident notification\nform in case the ICT-related incident is classified\
        \ as a major or significant incident.\n\u2022 Introduces a specific chapter\
        \ to cover in the same Circular the incident notification requirements\n(previously\
        \ communicated via bilateral communications to Supervised Entities that are\
        \ under\nthe scope of the NIS Law) in order to apply the new incident reporting\
        \ notification forms and\npractical requirements to the notifications of incidents\
        \ assessed as significant under the NIS Law.\nThis Circular is divided in\
        \ four chapters:\n\u2022 Chapter 1 (Definitions and scope of application)\
        \ sets out the definitions applicable for the\npurpose of this Circular and\
        \ defines the scope of application;\n\u2022 Chapter 2 (General requirements)\
        \ sets out the requirements for the classification and reporting\nof the ICT-related\
        \ incidents;\n\u2022 Chapter 3 (Specific requirements under the NIS Law and\
        \ CSSF Regulation No 24-01) is dedicated\nto specific requirements for those\
        \ Supervised Entities that are subject to the NIS Law and CSSF\nRegulation\
        \ No 24-01 and that are defined as OES or DSP;\n\u2022 Chapter 4 (Date of\
        \ application) provides for the entry into force of this Circular."
